This is my sandbox for experimenting with Golang and keeping a collection of code examples in one place to refer to.

So far I have a hello world example, a simple web server that renders strings and static HTML content, and some notes detailing how to do these things in Go.  I also have a bunch of example code taken from https://tour.golang.org.
